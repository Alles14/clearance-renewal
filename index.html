    <section>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://policeclearanceph.ph/police-clearance-renewal/" target="_blank">Police Clearance Renewal</a> process in the Philippines has become simpler and more efficient, thanks to digital platforms that make it easier to renew clearances without long queues. This guide explains what renewal means, how to apply online or in person, and what requirements you need to prepare.
      </p>

      <div class="box">
        <strong>Quick Fact:</strong> A police clearance is valid for six months, but you can renew it online before expiration through the National Police Clearance System (NPCS).
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Renewal Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Renewing your police clearance ensures that your criminal background record remains updated and valid for employment, government, or travel purposes. Many agencies require that the document is less than six months old to confirm your current record status.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Eligibility for Police Clearance Renewal</h2>
      <p>
        Anyone who previously obtained a police clearance can apply for renewal. The renewal process is primarily for individuals whose clearances are near expiration but whose personal information has not changed significantly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Documents Required for Renewal</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Expired or soon-to-expire police clearance certificate</li>
        <li>Two (2) valid government-issued IDs (e.g., Passport, Driver’s License, PhilID)</li>
        <li>Latest transaction reference number (if renewing online)</li>
        <li>Updated proof of residence (if address has changed)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide for Police Clearance Renewal</h2>

      <h3>1. Visit the Official Portal</h3>
      <p>
        Go to the official <a href="https://policeclearanceph.ph/police-clearance-renewal/" target="_blank">Police Clearance Renewal</a> page. Log in using your existing account or register a new one if you haven’t before.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Update Your Profile</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure your information is accurate — name, address, and contact details must match your previous clearance details. Any discrepancy may cause a verification delay.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Choose “Renew Clearance” Option</h3>
      <p>
        Once logged in, click on the <em>Renew Clearance</em> option. You’ll be prompted to confirm your last transaction and select your preferred police station for verification.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Schedule Your Appointment</h3>
      <p>
        Pick your preferred date and time for biometrics and verification. It’s best to schedule early in the morning to avoid long queues.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Pay the Renewal Fee</h3>
      <p>
        The renewal fee is usually ₱150 to ₱200, depending on your police station. Payment can be made online or through authorized partners like GCash or Landbank.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Biometrics and Photo Capture</h3>
      <p>
        Visit your selected station at your scheduled date. The officer will capture your photo and fingerprints to renew your record in the system.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Claim or Download Your Clearance</h3>
      <p>
        Once approved, you may claim the printed certificate or download a digital version. The digital clearance is verifiable through a QR code.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Online vs. Walk-In Renewal</h2>
      <p>
        Online renewal is more efficient and recommended for applicants with no changes in personal information. However, first-time applicants or those with updated personal data may need to visit the police station.
